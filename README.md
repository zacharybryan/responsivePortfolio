# My Responsive Portfolio Website #


This is the code for my responsive portfolio. These pages were created with Bootstrap. I used very little css. I wanted to use all the tools bootstrap provided. The only items in my css code are background image and footer. I also edited the links to my social media with css.

## Resources ##



[Bootstrap 4.4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
